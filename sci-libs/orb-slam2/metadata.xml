  g2o is an open-source C++ framework for optimizing graph-based
  nonlinear error functions. g2o has been designed to be easily
  extensible to a wide range of problems and a new problem typically
  can be specified in a few lines of code. The current implementation
  provides solutions to several variants of SLAM and BA.

  A wide range of problems in robotics as well as in computer-vision
  involve the minimization of a non-linear error function that can be
  represented as a graph. Typical instances are simultaneous localization
  and mapping (SLAM) or bundle adjustment (BA). The overall goal in these
  problems is to find the configuration of parameters or state variables
  that maximally explain a set of measurements affected by Gaussian noise.
  g2o is an open-source C++ framework for such nonlinear least squares
  problems. g2o has been designed to be easily extensible to a wide range
  of problems and a new problem typically can be specified in a few lines
  of code. The current implementation provides solutions to several variants
  of SLAM and BA. g2o offers a performance comparable to implementations of
  state-of-the-art approaches for the specific problems (02/2011).

ArchenROOT Gentoo Overlay

https://github.com/gentoo/travis-repo-checks

This is experimental overlay and mostly focused on CUDA, OpenCL, BigData and high-performance Java and other packages.

Lots of packages needs QA and metadata to be defined well, I firstly focus on get it working "somehow" :-)

Please report any issues or enhancement which are well welcomed.

In the moment I focus mostly on:
- GPU development for relation and graph databases for new GAIA database GPU accelerated engine (there will be limited open-source edition available soon)
- Neural Neworks for image/speech/behavior recognition
- Anything cool

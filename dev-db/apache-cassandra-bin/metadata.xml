    The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
    and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability
    and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure
    make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support
    for replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing
    lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can
    survive regional outages.
    
    Cassandra's data model offers the convenience of column indexes with
    the performance of log-structured updates, strong support
    for denormalization and materialized views, and powerful built-in caching.
